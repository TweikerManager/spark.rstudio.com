## Overview

The **rsparkling** extension package provides bindings to H2O's distributed [machine learning](http://www.h2o.ai/product/algorithms/) algorithms via **sparklyr**. In particular, rsparkling allows you to access the machine learning routines provided by the [Sparkling Water](http://www.h2o.ai/product/sparkling-water/) package. 

Together with sparklyr's [dplyr](dplyr.html) interface, you can easily create and tune H2O machine learning workflows on Spark, orchestrated entirely within R.

rsparkling provides a few simple conversion functions that allow the user to transfer data between Spark DataFrames and H2O Frames.  Once the Spark DataFrames are available as H2O Frames, the **h2o** R interface can be used to train H2O machine learning algorithms on the data.

A typical machine learning pipeline with rsparkling might be composed of the following stages. To fit a model, you might need to:

1. Perform SQL queries through the sparklyr [dplyr](dplyr.html) interface,
2. Use the `sdf_*` and `ft_*` family of functions to generate new columns, or partition your data set,
3. Convert your training, validation and/or test data frames into H2O Frames using the `as_h2o_frame` function,
3. Choose an appropriate H2O machine learning algorithm to model your data,
4. Inspect the quality of your model fit, and use it to make predictions with new data.

### Installing rsparkling {.toc-ignore}

The latest version of rsparkling can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("h2oai/sparkling-water", ref="rsparkling", subdir = "/r/rsparkling")
```


## Algorithms

Once the `H2OContext` is made available to Spark, all of the functions in the standard h2o R interface can be used with H2O Frames (converted from Spark DataFrames).  Here is a table of the available algorithms:

### Algorithm Example {.toc-ignore}

Let's walk through a simple example to demonstrate the use of H2O's machine learning algorithms within R. We'll use [h2o.glm](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/glm.html) to fit a linear regression model. Using the built-in `mtcars` dataset, we'll try to predict a car's fuel consumption (`mpg`) based on its weight (`wt`), and the number of cylinders the engine contains (`cyl`).

Prior to starting this example, Spark must be installed (this only needs to be run once).

```{r}
# If requred, Spark can be installed via the sparklyr command:
spark_install(version = "1.6.2")
```


First, we will initialize a local Spark connection, and copy the `mtcars` dataset into Spark.

```{r}
library(rsparkling)
library(dplyr)

sc <- spark_connect("local", version = "1.6.2")
mtcars_tbl <- copy_to(sc, mtcars, "mtcars", overwrite = TRUE)
```

Now, let's perform some simple transformations -- we'll

1. Remove all cars with horsepower less than 100,
2. Produce a column encoding whether a car has 8 cylinders or not,
3. Partition the data into separate training and test data sets,
4. Fit a model to our training data set,
5. Evaluate our predictive performance on our test dataset.

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

```{r}
# transform our data set, and then partition into 'training', 'test'
partitions <- mtcars_tbl %>%
  filter(hp >= 100) %>%
  mutate(cyl8 = cyl == 8) %>%
  sdf_partition(training = 0.5, test = 0.5, seed = 1099)
```

Now, we convert our training and test sets into H2O Frames using rsparkling conversion functions.  We have already split the data into training and test frames using dplyr.  

```{r}
training <- as_h2o_frame(partitions$training)
test <- as_h2o_frame(partitions$test)
```

Alternatively, we can use the `h2o.splitFrame()` function instead of `sdf_partition()` to partition the data within H2O instead of Spark (e.g. `partitions <- h2o.splitFile(as_h2o_frame(mtcars_tbl), 0.5)`) 


```{r}
# fit a linear model to the training dataset
fit <- h2o.glm(x = c("wt", "cyl"), 
               y = "mpg", 
               training_frame = training,
               lambda_search = TRUE)
```




For linear regression models produced by H2O, we can use either `print()` or `summary()` to learn a bit more about the quality of our fit.  The `summary()` method returns some extra information about scoring history and variable importance.

```{r}
print(fit)
```
```

The output suggests that our model is a fairly good fit, and that both a cars weight, as well as the number of cylinders in its engine, will be powerful predictors of its average fuel consumption. (The model suggests that, on average, heavier cars consume more fuel.)

Let's use our H2O model fit to predict the average fuel consumption on our test data set, and compare the predicted response with the true measured fuel consumption. We'll build a simple ggplot2 plot that will allow us to inspect the quality of our predictions.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# compute predicted values on our test dataset
pred <- h2o.predict(fit, newdata = test)
# convert from H2O Frame to Spark DataFrame
predicted <- as_spark_dataframe(pred, sc)

# extract the true 'mpg' values from our test dataset
actual <- partitions$test %>%
  select(mpg) %>%
  collect() %>%
  `[[`("mpg")

# produce a data.frame housing our predicted + actual 'mpg' values
data <- data.frame(
  predicted = predicted,
  actual    = actual
)
# a bug in data.frame does not set colnames properly; reset here 
names(data) <- c("predicted", "actual")

# plot predicted vs. actual values
ggplot(data, aes(x = actual, y = predicted)) +
  geom_abline(lty = "dashed", col = "red") +
  geom_point() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Actual Fuel Consumption",
    y = "Predicted Fuel Consumption",
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Fuel Consumption"
  )
```

![](images/mtcars-regression.png)

Although simple, our model appears to do a fairly good job of predicting a car's average fuel consumption.

As you can see, we can easily and effectively combine dplyr data transformation pipelines with the machine learning algorithms provided by H2O's Sparkling Water.


## Transformers

A model is often fit not on a dataset as-is, but instead on some transformation of that dataset. Spark provides [feature transformers](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html), facilitating many common transformations of data within a Spark DataFrame, and sparklyr exposes these within the `ft_*` family of functions.  Transformers can be used on Spark DataFrames, and the final training set can be sent to the H2O cluster for machine learning.  A full list of these feature transformers can be found on the [MLlib page](http://spark.rstudio.com/mllib.html#transformers).


## Examples

We will use the `iris` data set to examine a handful of learning algorithms and transformers. The iris data set measures attributes for 150 flowers in 3 different species of iris.

```{r}
library(rsparkling)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
sc <- spark_connect("local", version = "1.6.2")
iris_tbl <- copy_to(sc, iris, "iris", overwrite = TRUE)
iris_tbl
```
```

# ... with more rows
```
Convert to an H2O Frame:
```{r}
iris_hf <- as_h2o_frame(iris_tbl)
```

### K-Means Clustering

Use H2O's [K-means clustering](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/k-means.html) to partition a dataset into groups. K-means clustering partitions points into `k` groups, such that the sum of squares from points to the assigned cluster centers is minimized.

```{r}
kmeans_model <- h2o.kmeans(training_frame = iris_hf, 
                           x = 3:4,
                           k = 3,
                           seed = 1)
```


To look at particular metrics of the K-means model, we can use `h2o.centroid_stats()` and `h2o.centers()` or simply print out all the model metrics using `print(kmeans_model)`.

```{r}
# print the cluster centers
h2o.centers(kmeans_model)
```
```
  petal_length petal_width
1     1.462000     0.24600
2     5.566667     2.05625
3     4.296154     1.32500
```

```{r}
# print the centroid statistics
h2o.centroid_stats(kmeans_model)
```
```
Centroid Statistics: 
  centroid     size within_cluster_sum_of_squares
1        1 50.00000                       1.41087
2        2 48.00000                       9.29317
3        3 52.00000                       7.20274
```


### Logistic Regression

Use H2O's [logistic regression](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/glm.html) to perform logistic regression, modeling a binary outcome as a function of one or more explanatory variables.  In this example, we also perform 3-fold cross-validation and evaluate the performance of the model.

```{r}
# Prepare beaver dataset
beaver <- beaver2
beaver$activ <- factor(beaver$activ, labels = c("Non-Active", "Active"))
beaver_hf <- as.h2o(beaver)

y <- "activ"
x <- setdiff(names(beaver_hf), y)
glm_model <- h2o.glm(x = x, 
                     y = y,
                     training_frame = beaver_hf,
                     family = "binomial",
                     nfolds = 3,
                     seed = 1)

glm_perf <- h2o.performance(glm_model, xval = TRUE)
```
```

### Principal Components

Use H2O's [Principal Components Analysis (PCA)](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/pca.html) to perform dimensionality reduction. PCA is a statistical method to find a rotation such that the first coordinate has the largest variance possible, and each succeeding coordinate in turn has the largest variance possible.

```{r}
pca_model <- h2o.prcomp(training_frame = iris_hf,
                        x = 1:4,
                        k = 4,
                        seed = 1)
print(pca_model)
```
```

### Random Forest

Use H2O's [Random Forest](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/drf.html) to perform regression or classification on a dataset.

As usual, we define the response and predictor variables using the `x` and `y` arguments.  Since we'd like to do a classification, we need to ensure that the response column is encoded as a factor (enum) column.

```{r}
y <- "Species"
x <- c("Petal_Length", "Petal_Width")
iris_hf[,y] <- as.factor(iris_hf[,y])
```

We can split the `iris_hf` H2O Frame into a train and test set (the split defaults to 75/25 train/test).
```{r}
splits <- h2o.splitFrame(iris_hf, seed = 1)
```

Then we can train a Random Forest model:
```{r}
rf_model <- h2o.randomForest(x = x, 
                             y = y,
                             training_frame = splits[[1]],
                             validation_frame = splits[[2]],
                             nbins = 32,
                             max_depth = 5,
                             ntrees = 20,
                             seed = 1)

```

Since we passed a validation frame, the validation metrics will be calculated.  We can retrieve individual metrics using functions such as `h2o.mse(rf_model, valid = TRUE)`.  The confusion matrix can be printed using the following:

```{r}
h2o.confusionMatrix(rf_model, valid = TRUE)
```
```
Confusion Matrix: vertical: actual; across: predicted
           setosa versicolor virginica  Error     Rate
setosa          7          0         0 0.0000 =  0 / 7
versicolor      0         13         0 0.0000 = 0 / 13

Totals          7         14        10 0.0323 = 1 / 31
```
