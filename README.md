This is an [R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) which documents the use of Spark with R.

You can follow the instructions at the above site to get started. In short, if you're on a relatively recent version of the RStudio IDE, you should see a `Build` tab when you oepn the RStudio project contained in this repo; clicking `Build Website` there will do everything you need.

See `_site.yml` for high-level changes to things like the navbar or overall structure. Otherwise, edit the associated Rmd for the page you want to change.
