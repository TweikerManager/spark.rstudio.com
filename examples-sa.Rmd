## Overview

The plan is to launch 4 identical EC2 server instances. One server will be the Master node and the other 3 the worker nodes. In one of the worker nodes, we will install RStudio server.

What makes a server the Master node is only the fact that it is running the **master** service, while the other machines are running the **slave** service and are pointed to that first master.  This simple setup, allows us to install the same Spark components on all 4 servers and then just add RStudio to one of them.

The topology will look something like this:

## AWS EC Instances

Here are the details of the EC2 instance, just deploy one at this point:

- **Type:** t2.medium
- **OS:** Ubuntu 14 (Trusty)
- **Disk space:** At least 20GB 
- **Security group:** Consider opening the following ports: 8080 (Spark UI), 4040 (Spark Worker UI), 8088 (sparklyr UI), 8787 (RStudio)


### Terminal connection

Next you need to setup add a password to the certificate on the “Key Pair” downloaded from AWS. Amazon provides the step-by-step instructions for this part:

- **Windows** – http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.htmlComplete sections "Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen" and "Starting a PuTTY Session"
    
- **Non-Windows** – http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html. Only go through the instructions in the To connect to your instance using SSH section



## Spark

Perform the steps in this section on all of the servers that will be part of the cluster.

### Install Java 8

```{}
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default
sudo apt-get update
```

### Download Spark

Download and unpack a pre-compiled version of Spark.  Here's is the link to the [official Spark download page](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)

```{}
wget http://d3kbcqa49mib13.cloudfront.net/spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
tar -xvzf spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
cd spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7
```

### Create and launch AMI

- We will create an image of the server.  In Amazon, these are called AMIs, for information please see the [User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html).

- Launch 3 instances of the AMI 

### Start the Master node

- Select one of the 4 servers to become your Master node

- Run the command that starts the master service
```{}
sudo spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7/sbin/start-master.sh
```

- Close the terminal connection (optional)

### Start Worker nodes

- Start the slave service. **Important**: Use dots not dashes as separators for the Spark Master node's address
```{}
sudo spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7/sbin/start-slave.sh spark://[Master node's IP address]:7077
``` 

- Close the terminal connection (optional)

## RStudio Server

Select one of the worker nodes to execute this section. Please check the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/) for the latest version

### Install R

- In order to get the latest R core, we will need to update the source list in Ubuntu.
```{}
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
```

- Now we can install R
```{}
sudo apt-get install r-base
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
```

### Install RStudio

- We will download and install 1.044 of RStudio Server.  To find the latest version, please visit the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/).  In order to get the enhanced integration with Spark, RStudio version 1.044 or later will be needed.
```{}
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-1.0.44-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.0.44-amd64.deb
```

### Install dependencies

- Run the following commands
```{}
sudo apt-get -y install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libxml2-dev
```

### Add default user

- Run the following command to add a default user
```{}
sudo adduser rstudio-user
```

### Pre-load pacakges

- Log into RStudio (port 8787)

- Use 'rstudio-user'
```{}
install.packages("sparklyr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- Install Spark files
```{}
spark_install("2.0.1")
```

### Connect to the Spark Master

- Navigate to the Spark Master's UI, typically on port 8080 <img src="images/spark-master.png" class="screenshot" width=639 height=446/>

- Note the **Spark Master URL**

- Logon to RStudio 

- Run the following code
```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)

spark_connect(master="[Spark Master URL]", 
              version = "2.0.1", 
              spark_home = spark_home_dir())
```
