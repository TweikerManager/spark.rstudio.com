The examples below showcase R applications and analysis performed using Sparklyr. You can see how to use dplyr and machine learning functions within [R Notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html), and create interactive dashboards with Spark connections using [flexdashboards](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html) and [Shiny Applications](http://shiny.rstudio.com).
